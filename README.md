# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
This game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to mark their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). 
The objective is to get three of the same symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features
Two-Player Mode: Play with a friend by taking turns marking 'X' and 'O'.

Simple Interface: Easy-to-use interface to mark the grid and track the gameâ€™s progress.

Win Condition: Automatically checks for a winner after each turn or a draw if the grid is full.

Game Restart: After a game ends, the option to restart and play again.

## How to Play
The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.

Player 1 uses 'X', and Player 2 uses 'O'.

Players take turns selecting an empty cell on the grid.

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.

If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

Players can restart the game after it ends.

## Technology Stack
The game is built using Python.

Optionally, graphical libraries like pygame can be used for a more visually appealing experience.

Game Modes
Local Play: Two players can play locally on the same machine by taking turns.

Terminal or GUI: The game can be played in the terminal or with a graphical user interface depending on the version.
